Foot was also likened to Worzel Gummidge in the series of letters purported to have been written by Denis Thatcher , husband of Margaret Thatcher to his fictional friend Bill which appeared in Private Eye . Method of Fluxions is a book by Isaac Newton .
The book was completed in 1671 , and published in 1736 .
Fluxions is Newton 's term for differential calculus -LRB- fluents was his term for integral calculus -RRB- .
He originally developed the method at Woolsthorpe Manor during the closing of Cambridge during the Great Plague of London from 1665 to 1667 , but did not choose to make his findings known -LRB- similarly , his findings which eventually became the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica were developed at this time and hidden from the world in Newton 's notes for many years -RRB- .
Gottfried Leibniz developed his calculus around 1673 , and published it in 1684 , fifty years before Newton .
The calculus notation we use today is mostly that of Leibniz , although Newton 's dot notation for differentiation for denoting derivatives with respect to time is still in current use throughout mechanics and circuit analysis .
